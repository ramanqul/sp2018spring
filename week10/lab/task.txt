1. create a timer which will execute every second and print time.
Use <linux/timer.h> to acomplish this task.

2. <linux/hrtimer.h> create hrtimer and dynamically schedule it using fibonacci 
sequence, so for example your timer starts running first 1nano, 1 nano, 2n, 3n, 5n, 
10s. how many executins have been done between those timings.
